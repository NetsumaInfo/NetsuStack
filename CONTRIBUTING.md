# Contributing to Portly

Thanks for helping make local development calmer and more predictable.

## Before you start

- Search existing issues before opening a new one.
- For substantial changes, open a discussion or issue before writing code.
- Keep changes focused. Portly is intentionally small and native.
- Never include API keys, tokens, private paths, or real project logs in a report.

## Local development

Portly requires macOS 14 or newer and Swift 6.

```bash
swift build
./build.sh --no-install
```

The Linux CLI lives in `cli/`:

```bash
cd cli
go test ./...
go build -o portly .
```

The landing page is a separate TanStack Start app:

```bash
cd website
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Pull requests

1. Create a focused branch.
2. Add or update tests when behavior changes.
3. Run `swift build -c release` and `pnpm --dir website build`.
4. Explain the problem, the chosen solution, and the verification performed.
5. Keep user-facing copy in English.
